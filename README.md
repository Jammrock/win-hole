# win-hole
A simple Windows DNS implementation of the pi-hole project, but for Windows Server 2016/2019 running DNS server. 

The original project can be found here.

https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole

The project is PowerShell based and uses DNS policies to block or redirect (i.e. black hole) DNS requests to known ad and malware servers.

The project is created and maintained by a handful of Microsoft employees, but this is NOT a Microsoft open source project. Support for 
win-hole is only offered through the project site.
